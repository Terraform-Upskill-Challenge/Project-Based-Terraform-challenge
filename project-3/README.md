# Project 3: Production Hardening & CI/CD

## Overview

**Duration**: 3 Weeks (Days 26-40)  
**Goal**: Add production-ready features: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, security hardening, and optimizations.

By the end of Project 3, you'll have:
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening
- Backup strategies
- Performance optimization
- Production-ready infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before starting Project 3, ensure you have:

- [ ] Completed Project 2 (Cloud Resume Platform)
- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- [ ] Docker knowledge (for Track B)
- [ ] Monitoring concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to Project 3

```bash
cd project-3
```

### 2. Continue from Project 2

Your infrastructure from Project 2 continues to grow. Each day adds production features.

## Important Notes

### Two Tracks for Week 6

**Day 26** is a decision point:
- **Track A (Beginner)**: Keep Lambda, add enhancements (caching, analytics, rate limiting)
- **Track B (Advanced)**: Refactor to ECS Fargate (learn containers)

Choose based on your experience and learning goals.

### Infrastructure Continuity

- Continue using the same infrastructure from Project 2
- State is shared across all projects
- Be careful with state operations

## Daily Workflow

1. **Read** the day's README.md
2. **Review** previous infrastructure
3. **Research** new concepts
4. **Build** the new features
5. **Test** thoroughly
6. **Document** changes
7. **Commit** progress

## Deliverables

At the end of Project 3, you should have:

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security best practices applied
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Complete production-ready platform
